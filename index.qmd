## Teaching Intermediate R

by: Kelly Bodwin, Tyson Barrett & Allison Theobold

# Welcome!

Welcome to the [USCOTS workshop on teaching intermediate R](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots25/program/workshops/w01)! The goal for the workshop is to provide structured learning goals, course material resources, and skills training for instructors of intermediate to advanced R courses.

This workshop is geared towards educators who may have taught a first course in R or used R as supporting software in other statistics courses, and who are interested in teaching a second R course or beyond.

## Learning Objectives for Workshop

We will first establish a suggested common curriculum for intermediate R based on five areas: Data types and sources beyond comma-separated files, advanced and dynamic data visualization, complexities of unclean or unstructured data, speed and efficiency concerns for large or repeated analyses, and reproducible workflow for long-term collaborative projects.

Following the introduction to each topic, we will have educators consider how these topics could be incorporated into a projet for their specific course.

## Intended Audience and Level

We expect attendees to have R fluency at the level of a typical introductory course, such as the textbook [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) (Wickham, Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, & Grolemund 2023); as well as familiarity with some scattered intermediate to advanced topics, interpreted broadly.

The focus of this workshop will not be training in intermediate R skills, but rather in preparing educators to deliver higher-level R courses. We will provide resources, examples, and frameworks to empower attendees to expand their R knowledge and design a meaningful hands-on classroom experience.
