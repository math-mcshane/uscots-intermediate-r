# What is a package workflow?

## Why a package workflow?

* Ease students into *developer* mindset.

* Emphasize *unit-testing* and *documentation* frameworks.

* Practice with *code review* of others' code.

* Easier to *performance check* code.

* Grading via automatic tests.

## How-to

1. Create a **skeleton R package** on GitHub.

2. Include **pre-written unit tests**.

3. Include **vignette-style** function demos.

4. Duplicate unit tests **with a new dataset** for your own use in grading.

5. Require **code review** as part of assignment.

## Student Assignment

1. Complete the functions.

2. Document the functions.

3. Build the package.

4. Run the unit tests.

5. Render the demo document.

## What do students turn in?

1. A link to their GitHub of the package.  [I recommend GitHub Classroom for this.](https://classroom.github.com/)

2. A rendered html, showing the functions being run on data.

3. A code review of someone else's package.

## Grading

Four grading elements to combine:

* Does the package **properly build and install** or are there errors?

* Does the package pass the **provided unit tests**?

* Do the package functions behave as expected in the **demo document**?

* Are the **peer code reviews** positive?

* Does the package pass the **secret unit tests**?


# OUR TURN

# Setup

## Make a sandbox for yourself

1. Make a folder somewhere called "Package Assignment Practice" or similar.

2. Run `usethis::create_package("YOUR PATH/Package Assignment Practice/example_skeleton_package")`.  This will open a new R Project.

3. In the new project, run `usethis::use_r("simple_linear_regression")`

4. Run `usethis::use_test("simple_linear_regression")`

5. New File > Quarto > `slr_demo.qmd`


## Create the demo document *first*

Include code that you hope will work properly...

```{r}
#| eval: false

simple_linear_regression(data = mtcars,
                         explanatory = "gear",
                         response = "mpg")
```

... and code you hope will error in a reasonable way.

```{r}
#| eval: false

simple_linear_regression(data = mtcars,
                         explanatory = "gear",
                         response = "not a variable")
```



## Sketch out the function

How much detail you provide depends on the level of your students.

For the first pass, I recommend:

* Include *all* the `roxygen`-style documentation

* Include the **inputs** and names.

* Give them **a few lines** to get started.

* Use **comments** to show where you want them to edit.

* Provide the **object structure of the expected output**.

* Make sure the code is all **runnable as-is**.  (But not fully correct yet!)

## Example

```
#' Implements simple linear regression by hand
#'
#' @param dat A data frame
#' @param response The name of a response variable in the data frame.
#' @param explanatory The name of the explanatory variable in the data frame.
#'
#' @return A data frame of coefficients
#'
#' @import dplyr
#'
#' @export
simple_linear_regression <- function(dat, response, explanatory){

  x <- dat[[explanatory]]
  y <- dat[[response]]

  x_bar <- mean(x)
  y_bar <- mean(y)

  ### Edit code after here

  sd_x <- 1
  sd_y <- 1

  beta_0 <- 1
  beta_1 <- 1

  results <- tibble::tibble(
    Intercept = 0,
    Slope = 1
  )

  return(results)

}
```

## Unit tests

```
test_that("simple linear regression is correct", {

  my_result <- simple_linear_regression(mtcars, "mpg", "hp")

  mass_result <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)

  expect_equal(coef(mass_result)[['hp']], my_result$Slope,
               tolerance = 0.05)
  expect_equal(coef(mass_result)[[1]], my_result$Intercept,
               tolerance = 0.05)

})
```

## Secret Unit Tests

* Make a **copy** of the `tests` folder in your package.

* Save that copy **outside the package folder**, in your "Package Assignment Practice" folder.

* Change the unit test code to use a **different dataset** or **different variables**.

# Activity: Be the student

## Auto-grading with secret tests

Open the script "testthat.R" ...

```
library(testthat)
library(example_skeleton_package)

test_check("example_skeleton_package")
```

... and run it!

## Working with GitHub

If student work is on GitHub rather than in folders...

```
remotes::install_github("imastudent/example_skeleton_package")
```

... and loop through each.

## Automation

```
urls <- # list of student repos

all_test_results <- tibble()
all_time_results <- tibble()

for (url in submissions){
  
    unloadNamespace("example_skeleton_package")
    remove.packages("example_skeleton_package", ".")
    
    remotes::install_github(submissions)

    library(example_skeleton_package)

    lr_test <- testthat::test_dir("./tests/testthat",
               reporter = "minimal",
               stop_on_failure = FALSE)
      
      ## save output however you prefer
    
}
```



# Leveling up {background-color="#0F4C81"}

## Function design/development

* Remove inputs and output from scaffolding

* Require *tidy eval* and unquoted variables ([Starting Point](https://dcl-prog.stanford.edu/tidy-eval-detailed.html))

* Emphasize code review (["Code Smells and Feels" talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzRn-QnOhug))

* Emphasize responsible use of Git and GitHub


## Package creation

* Don't provide `roxygen2` documentation; require students do it.

* Require additional unit tests

* Require multiple `.R` files and multiple functions per file.

* Practice CRAN submission?

* [R Packages Textbook](https://r-pkgs.org/)

## Statistical computing

* Matrix operations, e.g. for *multiple regression*

* Iteration to convergence, e.g. *kmeans*

* Model fitting via gradient descent

* Emphasize speed/efficiency

## Speed/memory tests


```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

big_dat <- #some large dataset
  
for (url in submissions){
  
    unloadNamespace("example_skeleton_package")
    remove.packages("example_skeleton_package", ".")
    
    remotes::install_github(submissions)

    library(example_skeleton_package)

    benches <- bench::mark(
      slr = safely(simple_linear_regression)(big_dat, price, gearbox),
      memory = FALSE,
      check = FALSE,
      time_unit = "ms",
      min_time = Inf,
      max_iterations = 20,
      filter_gc = FALSE
    ) %>%
      select(
        expression, median
      ) 
    
}
```
