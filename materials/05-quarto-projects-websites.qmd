Quarto Projects & Websites
:::

## Quarto Projects

are directories that provide the ability to...

::: {.small}
- render all or some of the files in a directory with a single command (e.g. `quarto render myproject`)

- share a YAML configuration across multiple documents

- redirect output artifacts to another directory

- freeze rendered output (i.e. don‚Äôt re-execute documents unless they have changed)
:::

## Types of Projects 

Use the `quarto create project` command (in the terminal) to create a new project:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto create project
```

. . .

You will then be given a variety of options for projects:

``` {.bash filename="Output"}
 ? Type
 ‚ùØ default
   website
   blog
   manuscript
   book
   confluence
```

## Say we chose to make a website...

</br>

Our website would come pre-populated with five initial files:

![](images/05-trial-website-initial-files.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the five files that come premade when you create a new Quarto website in RStudio. The files are named _quarto.yml, about.qmd, index.qmd, styles.css, trial-website.Rproj."}

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; color: #0F4C81;"}
::: {.centered}
Let's talk about each file!
:::
:::

## `.Rproj` -- Where does your analysis live?

> R has a powerful notion of a working directory--where R looks for files that you ask it
> to load, and where it will store any files that you ask it to save. 
> 
> *R for Data Science* 

. . .

RStudio shows your current working directory at the top of the console:

![](images/05-working-directory.png)

## `.Rproj` -- Where does your analysis live?

Keeping all the files associated with a given project (data, R scripts, figures, etc.) together in **one**
directory is such a wise and common practice that RStudio has built-in support for this via 
RStudio projects (`.Rproj`). 

</br> 

::: {.centered}
![](images/05-rstudio-project.png){fig-alt="A translucent blue cube with a capital R in the center. The image is the logo of an RStudio project." width=30%}

:::

## File Paths (üò©)

::: {.midi}
Inside a `.Rproj`, you can access files using a **relative** path. Absolute paths should never be used!
:::

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.midi}
</br>

If I wanted to access the `students.xlsx` file in the `data` folder of my project, I could use `data/students.csv` to access these data. 
:::
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
![](images/05-data-folder.png){fig-alt="A screen shot of the same project as displayed previously (with five files), but a data folder has been added to the project files." width=80%}
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.midi}
This is different from the **full path** (where the file lives on my computer): `/Users/atheobol/Desktop/trial-website/data/students.csv`.
:::

## .yml Files

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "trial-website"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - about.qmd

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    css: styles.css
    toc: true

editor: visual
```

## `.css`

A Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) file is a style sheet language used in web development to describe the presentation and formatting of documents written in HTML or XML. 

::: {.centered}

:::

##

::: {.midi}
::: columns
::: {.column width="47%"}
[`index.qmd`]{.large}

- This is the home page for the website! 

- Whatever you place in the `index.qmd` file will be the first page people see! 

- This page is also accessed using the top navigation menu (on the left side) using the link titled "Home."
:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
[`about.qmd`]{.large}

- This is an additional content page! 
- This is accessed through the top navigation menu. 
- Notice that the `.yml` file doesn't give this page a name, so it defaults to the title included in the `about.qmd` document.

## Website Themes

``` {.bash}
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
```

::: {.midi}
Here is a list of every theme available for Quarto websites: <https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html>
:::

. . .

</br>

::: {.midi}
Optionally, you can set separate "light" and "dark" themes:
:::

``` {.bash}
theme:
  light: flatly
  dark: darkly
```

## How would you integrate websites into a course?

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
**Projects**

::: {.midi}
Are students already completing a project that includes R? 

Why not transform this project into something they can publish?
