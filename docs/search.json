She primarily teaches courses in statistical computing, data science, and predictive modeling. All her courses involve elements of programming - typically in R, with a focus on the tidyverse, but she is reluctantly learning to embrace a little python in her life. Kelly’s research includes applied statistics projects in a variety of fields and open-source software development. She is an author of multiple R packages including flair, tidyclust, shindig, and templar. She leads the Central Coast R Users group, and she is currently part of a major NSF-funded venture to expand the data.table package community and ecosystem.\n\n\n\nTyson Barrett is a researcher and an applied statistician at Highmark Health and Utah State University. He has over 15 years of R package development and programming experience, including maintaining data.table (with over 600,000 monthly downloads) and 3 other published R packages. He is currently a consultant on an NSF Grant building infrastructure for the data.table package. In his research work, he regularly works with large datasets with millions of rows and hundreds of columns. He and his team use data.table, arrow, and duckDB daily to manage and analyze their data to efficiently and quickly communicate insights with stakeholders.\n\n\n\nAllison Theobold is an Assistant Professor of Statistics at Cal Poly. Allison’s work focuses on innovation in statistics and data science education, with an emphasis on equitable pedagogy and learning trajectories. Allison is the lead PI on an NSF grant investigating methods for fostering equitable pair programming collaborations."
