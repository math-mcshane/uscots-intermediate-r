Use this drop-down to filter by state.\"\n\n* Keep your dashboard **sanitized** against bad statistical choices - e.g., don't allow users to select \"Show logistic regression\" for numeric data.\n\n## \"Why should I care?\"\n\n> Dashboards and presentations are for your target audience, not your peers.\n\n* What is interesting to a **data scientist** might not be interesting to your **target audience**.\n\n* Use **personas**: \n    + Give your client a name\n    + Why does this client want your analysis?\n    + What is their specific stake in the data?\n    + What level of technical content will they understand and appreciate?\n    \n* Stay focused on how the client **will use the analysis** to make decisions.\n\n## Example\n\n> My client is Nisha, a CEO of a small restaurant chain that competes with local fast food.  She has a degree in business administration, so she understands basic statistics. She has hired me to analyze price trends in the food industry.\n\n* Nisha is a CEO of a small business - she is probably interested in *how to keep her restaurant solvent*\n\n* We can quote *basic statistics*, but we should not go deep into modeling math.\n\n* She has asked specifically about *prices*, so our presentation should focus on that.\n\n* She has asked about *trends*, so our \"newspaper headline\" should be about changes over time.\n\n* We should state how our analysis will *help her set her prices* at her restaurants.\n\n## YOUR TURN\n\n::: {.r-fit-text}\nCome up with **three different personas** that your students might target with their dashboards.\n\nHow would you expect the dashboard to be **different** between these three personas?\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"countdown\" id=\"timer_f2c7fc9d\" data-update-every=\"1\" tabindex=\"0\" style=\"right:0;bottom:0;\">\n<div class=\"countdown-controls\"><button class=\"countdown-bump-down\">&minus;</button><button class=\"countdown-bump-up\">&plus;</button></div>\n<code class=\"countdown-time\"><span class=\"countdown-digits minutes\">03</span><span class=\"countdown-digits colon\">:</span><span class=\"countdown-digits seconds\">00</span></code>\n</div>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Activity ideas\n\n**Can the data answer this question?**\n\n* Give students a dataset and a list of questions\n\n**Is this conclusion supported?**\n\n* Give a *visualization* or *test result*, and a client quote - \"This means I should sell more hamburgers!\"\n\n* Ask students if they think the result supports the conclusion.\n\n**\"Client\" feedback**\n\n* Invent a mock client for *all* student groups to target\n\n* Have student groups swap projects and imagine themselves as the clients\n\n\n## Create your Project B Dashboard Assignment\n\n::: {.midi}\n* Who is the **target audience** that the student should address?\n\n* Will you require any **specific research questions** to be addressed, or is it open-ended?\n\n* Will you require any **specific dashboard elements**, such as interactivity?\n\n* How will you grade:\n    + the **design** elements?\n    + the **technical** elements?\n    + the **communication** elements?\n:::\n\n\n\n\n",
